# How to contribute
first of all we're really happy to see that you want to contribute and your contributions are always welcomed.
just for organizing the codebase, issues and PRs better follow these guides:
* Please look up the issues before working on something. it may have been discussed, assigned and etc.
* Please open a new issue before working on something that hasn't been discussed in the issues.
* Please keep your pull request small. It must does only one thing and does it right.
* Please choose descriptive titles and have detailed description.
* Your PRs need to pass every unit tests we have in order to be merged, so please before opening PR make sure all tests will pass.
* It would help a lot if you write documentation and tests.
* Your PR must be reviewed by one of the project's maintainers to be merged.

Have fun and Thanks!
